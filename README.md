## Polidea's Head Quater Unity model
This is a simplified model of Polidea's headquarters. It was made as a part of [Polidea Labs](https://www.polidea.com/blog/The_launch_of_Polidea_Labs/) initiative aimed at exploring capabilities of mobile devices to run Virtual Reality projects.

## How to use it
This model is created in Unity Game Engine. You can download a free copy of Unity Engine from [unity store](https://store.unity.com) for personal use.
